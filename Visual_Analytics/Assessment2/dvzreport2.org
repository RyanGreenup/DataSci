* Introduction
+ in December 2012 first cases of /COVID-19/ were reported, the disease has
  since attributed to the /SARS-CoV2/ virus.
+ The disease became endemic throughout China before spreading throughout Europe
  in an epidemic fashion and finally reaching the rest of the globe as a
  pandemic outbreak.


* Chloropleth Map
A Chloropleth map of the number of deaths can offer an insight into the impact
that the disease has had with respect to individual countries.

The Total deaths should be scaled relative to the population of the country,
that way countries with a smaller and sparser population will still be
represented by the visualisation (this is quite important given that many
countries such as Italy have a small population compared to the US and much of
Asia cite:2020n).

A worldwide Chloropleth map visualising the total number of deaths attributed to
/COVID-19/ is shown in figure [[map1]] and a Europe-centric visualisation is shown
in figure [[map2]].

** Discussion
*** Worldwide
The first plot appears to show a very limited amount of difference in deaths
attributable to /COVID-19/ across regions other than the North America and
Europe. While first-world countries such as New Zealand and Australia are
somewhat insulated from the disease by virtue of geography and population
density, it's striking that much of Asia and Russia have such low levels of
outbreak.

This could be attributed to the fact that a more power-cetric regime such as in
China, Russia, North Korea, etc. may have more capacity to:

1. Diminish the spread of the diseasy by implementing
   policy decisions,
   1. whereas countries such as the US and Europe have a much higher expectation
      of civil liberties.
2. Control the spread of information for want of international reputation.
   1. In saying that though research suggests that under-reporting has even
      occured in countries such as the US cite:sood2020 so such under-reporting
      could merely be incidental.

A similar disease, /MERS/, emerged in 2012 in Middle-Eastern Regions
cite:woodley2020 and a Korean outbreak of the /MERS/ disease occured in 2015
cite:serrano2015, these outbreaks likely prepared Korea, the Middle East and
other Asian Regions regions for an outbreak which helps explain the dichotomous
nature of the deaths attributable to /COVID-19/ for those Countries.

*** Europe
A closer look at Europe shows that Belgium and Italy have been the most affected
by this disease, it isn't very clear why those regions have been impacted so
significantly but this could be indicative of policy decisions and warrants
further research.

** Technique
*** Woldwide Map
First the data must be aggregated in order to retrieve the total number of
deaths, this can be acheived by taking the maximum of the total deaths across
countries (the total number of death rates will be a strictly positive and
monotone trend, otherwise the outbreak would be an entirely different type of
pandemic!), this can be performed by using the =aggregate= function as
demonstrated in figure [[agg]].

#+NAME: agg
#+CAPTION: Use Aggregate to aggregate total number of deaths
#+begin_src R :results output
fatalprop <- aggregate(total_deaths_per_million ~ location, covid, max)
## Order the Values in Descending Order
fatalprop <- fatalprop[order(-fatalprop$total_deaths_per_million),]
## Rename USA
covid$location[covid$location=="United States"] <- "USA"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: agg


It is next necessary to rename =location= to =region= so map data will be
consistent with the provided data set, this is shown in listing [[rnm]].

#+NAME: rnm
#+CAPTION: Rename Features for consistency
#+begin_src R
## Rename to facilitate joining with map
names(fatalprop) <- c("region", "total_deaths_per_million")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: rnm

For a broad overview of the data, small regions such as San Marino and Belgium
will not be visible and will skew the colour pallete, so instead they should be removed
and instead a seperate plot of Europe will be creted as shown in figure [[map2]], this removal is performed in
listing [[smb]].

#+NAME: smb
#+CAPTION: Filter out small dense regions to prevent scale issues
#+begin_src R
## San Marino will be shown by italy and this skews the results
## Belgium and San Marino are very hard to visualise from above
## They skew the rsults and so will be removed.
fatalprops <- fatalprop %>% filter(region!="San Marino")
fatalprops <- fatalprop %>% filter(region!="Belgium")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: smb


Next it is necessary to retrieve map data, this can be done using the =map_data=
function, this data may then be combined by region with the provided data set
using the =left_join= function, this is shown in listing [[jn]].

#+NAME: jn
#+CAPTION: Combine Map Data with Provided Data
#+begin_src R :results output
## Retrieve the map data
some.eu.maps <- map_data("world", region = fatalprops$location)

## Join the Data Frames Together
fatalmap <- left_join(fatalprops, some.eu.maps, by = "region")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: jn

Finally this data frame can be plotted by using =ggplot2= and the =geom_map=
layer, modifying the =theme= layer will allow to provide a natural background,
this is demonstrated in listing [[fggp]] and the output is provided in figure [[map1]].

#+NAME: fggp
#+CAPTION: use =ggplot2= to create a chloropleth map from data, output in figure [[map1]]
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output graphics file :file FirstChALL.png
 ggplot(fatalmap, aes(map_id = region)) +
  geom_map(map = fatalmap,  color = "grey", aes(fill = total_deaths_per_million), lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.6)+
  expand_limits(x = fatalmap$long, y = fatalmap$lat)+
  scale_fill_gradient(high = "darkred", low = "white") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend("Total Deaths \n per Million")) +
   # Change the colors of background
   # and the color of grid lines to white
   theme(
     panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                     colour = "lightblue",
                                     size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
     legend.position = c(0.6, 0.1),
     legend.direction = "horizontal",
     legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", size = 0.1, colour = "darkblue", linetype = "solid")) +
   labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", title = TeX("Total Deaths Attributed to \\textit{COVID-19}"))
#   geom_text(data = region_lab_df, aes(y = lat, x = long, label = region), size = 1)


#+end_src

*** Europe Centric
The chloropleth map clearly shows that the disease has caused more fatalities
per capita in Europe and so the plot will be adjusted central to Europe.

As before it is necessary to rename the features of the dataset, however in this
instance small European countries such as Belgium should be retained (San marino
is a very small italian provice that isn't detectable in the visualisation and
skews the pallete, for this reason it will be removed), this is demonstrated in
figure [[ren2]]

#+NAME: ren2
#+CAPTION: Rename the features of the data and remove San Marino
#+begin_src R
## Rename to facilitate joining with map
names(fatalprop) <- c("region", "total_deaths_per_million")

## San Marino will be shown by italy
 fatalprop <- fatalprop %>% filter(region!="San Marino")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: ren2

#+RESULTS:

In this map it will be desirable to have labels for the European countries
(whereas this would have made the worldwide map too busy), so this will be
implemented by using =dyplyr= to generate a second data set as shown in listing
[[dpl]] which can then be used to generate a plot with the =ggrepel= add on as shown in listing [[gg2]], this
produces the output shown in figure [[map2]], for this plut bubbles were also implemented in order to help visualise the number of relative cases.
thee inspiration for the use of bubbles was the /John Hopkins Coronavirus Dashboard/ cite:2020o where a similar strategy was implemented to visualise the number of cases, a screenshot of this is provided in the appendix at figure [[JHBub]].

  filter(30 <  lat & lat < 65) %>%
  filter(-30 <  long & long < 35)

  dplyr::group_by(region) %>%

* Time Series
The spread of disease over time can often be modelled by exponential model as demonstrated in equations eqref:exp1 and eqref:exp2, for this reason the use of a $\log$-scale will linearise trends and so the use of a $\log$-scale will make it easier to compare the rates of population change between different countries.



\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto p &\implies p = Ce^{kt} \quad \exists k,c \in \mathbb{R} \label{exp1} \\
  \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto p \wedge    \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto (N-p) &\implies p = \frac{ke^{Nt}}{1-ke^{Nt}} \quad \exists k \in \mathbb{R}, N \in \mathbb{R^+} \label{exp1} \label{exp2}
\end{align}

In addition to a $\log-$ scale, /sliding/ the data to be relative to the number of days since the first case can allow the trends of the data to be compared, this was implemented by /John Hopkins University/ in a visualisation published in the /Guardian/ cite:gutierrez2020. <<tssec>>

** Technical Details

** Advantages compared to other methods
+ The advantage to a log-scaled plot is that it allows rates of change to be
  compared between countries
+ Making the Data Relative to the day of the first infection allows individual
  countries to be compared in terms of there response
** Disasadvantages
+ A log-scaled plot can be misleading if it is not made clear, his particularly
  true for readers who have limited mathematical training.
  + For this reason a plot without log-scaling was included and the axis were
    labelled accordingly
+ Making Data relative to the day of the first infection may not make clear that
  certain countries had //forewarning/ of the disease by virtue of the delay.

As mentioned in section [[tssec]] the use of the log-scaled and date-adjusted plot was implemented by /John Hopkins University/ in a visualisation published in /The Guardian/ newspaper cite:gutierrez2020.
