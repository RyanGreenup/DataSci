\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org8153164}
On December 31st 2019 a viral pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China, this was
  later found to be a result of a new strain of virus named \emph{Sars-CoV2}, the
  diseased caused by such an infection, usually resulting in viral pneumonia, is
  known as \emph{Corona Virus Disease 2019} (\emph{COVID-19}). The outbreak of this disease was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30th January 2020.
  \cite{worldhealthorganization2020} December 2012 first cases of \emph{COVID-19} were
  reported, the disease has since attributed to the \emph{SARS-CoV2} virus.

A data set detailing the location, deaths, tests and cases related to the
\emph{COVID-19} pandemic has been made available through the website /Our World in
Data/\cite{ritchie2020}, documented in this report is a visual anylisis
performed entirely using the \emph{Free Software} \footnote{Free as in Speech and beer} \textbf{\emph{R}} \cite{rcoreteam2020}
primarily with the \texttt{ggplot2} package \cite{wickham2016} (see listing \ref{orgf1b0f83} in the
appendix).

\section{Chloropleth Map}
\label{sec:orgb778a6e}
A Chloropleth map of the number of deaths can offer an insight into the impact
that the disease has had with respect to individual countries.

The Total deaths should be scaled relative to the population of the country,
that way countries with a smaller and sparser population will still be
represented by the visualisation (this is quite important given that many
countries such as Italy have a small population compared to the US and much of
Asia \cite{2020n}).

A worldwide Chloropleth map visualising the total number of deaths attributed to
\emph{COVID-19} is shown in figure \ref{fig:orgb9d1c6a} and a Europe-centric visualisation is shown
in figure \ref{fig:org2f71c00}.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:org1f4bcf8}
\subsubsection{Worldwide}
\label{sec:orga81a162}
The first plot appears to show a very limited amount of difference in deaths
attributable to \emph{COVID-19} across regions other than North America and
Europe.

While first-world countries such as New Zealand and Australia are
somewhat insulated from the disease by virtue of geography and population
density, it's striking that much of Asia and Russia have such low levels of
disease incidence.

This could be attributed to the fact that a more power-cetric regime such as in
China, Russia, North Korea, etc. may have more capacity to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Diminish the spread of the diseasy by implementing
policy decisions,
\begin{enumerate}
\item whereas countries such as the US and Europe have a much higher expectation
of civil liberties and hence much lower tolerance for government intervention.
\end{enumerate}
\item Control the spread of information for want of international reputation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In saying that though research suggests that under-reporting has even
occured in countries such as the US \cite{sood2020} so such under-reporting
could merely be incidental.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

A similar disease, \emph{MERS}, emerged in 2012 in Middle-Eastern Regions
\cite{woodley2020} and a Korean outbreak of the \emph{MERS} disease occured in 2015
\cite{serrano2015}, these outbreaks likely prepared Korea, the Middle East and
other Asian regions for an outbreak which helps explain the dichotomous
nature of the deaths attributable to \emph{COVID-19} for those Countries.

\subsubsection{Europe}
\label{sec:org86bbed3}
A closer look at Europe shows that Belgium and Italy have been the most affected
by this disease, it isn't very clear why those regions have been impacted so
significantly, particularly considering the comparatively permissive borders
within the \emph{EU}, but this could be indicative of policy decisions and warrants
further research.

\subsection{Technique}
\label{sec:orgcbda394}
\subsubsection{Woldwide Map}
\label{sec:org2fa4c82}
In order to produce a chloropleth map the data must be aggregated in order to retrieve the total number of
deaths, this can be acheived by taking the maximum of the total deaths across
countries (the total number of death rates will be a strictly positive and
monotone trend, otherwise the outbreak would be an entirely different type of
pandemic!), this can be performed by using the \texttt{aggregate} function as
demonstrated in listing \ref{org347d4df}.

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
fatalprop <- aggregate(total_deaths_per_million ~ location, covid, max)
## Order the Values in Descending Order
fatalprop <- fatalprop[order(-fatalprop$total_deaths_per_million),]
## Rename USA
covid$location[covid$location=="United States"] <- "USA"
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{org347d4df}Use Aggregate to aggregate total number of deaths}
\end{listing}


It is next necessary to rename \texttt{location} to \texttt{region} so map data will be
consistent with the provided data set, this is shown in listing \ref{orgefdab1b}.

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
## Rename to facilitate joining with map
names(fatalprop) <- c("region", "total_deaths_per_million")
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{orgefdab1b}Rename Features for consistency}
\end{listing}

For a broad overview of the data, small regions such as San Marino and Belgium
will not be visible and will skew the colour pallete, so instead they should be removed
and instead a seperate plot of Europe will be creted as shown in figure \ref{fig:org2f71c00}, this removal is performed in
listing \ref{org16dd651}.

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
## San Marino will be shown by italy and this skews the results
## Belgium and San Marino are very hard to visualise from above
## They skew the rsults and so will be removed.
fatalprops <- fatalprop %>% filter(region!="San Marino")
fatalprops <- fatalprop %>% filter(region!="Belgium")
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{org16dd651}Filter out small dense regions to prevent scale issues}
\end{listing}


Next it is necessary to retrieve map data, this can be done using the \texttt{map\_data}
function, this data may then be combined by region with the provided data set
using the \texttt{left\_join} function, this is shown in listing \ref{org19102a6}.

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
## Retrieve the map data
some_maps <- map_data("world", region = fatalprops$location)

## Join the Data Frames Together
fatalmap <- left_join(fatalprops, some_maps, by = "region")
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{org19102a6}Combine Map Data with Provided Data}
\end{listing}

Finally this data frame can be plotted by using \texttt{ggplot2} and the \texttt{geom\_map}
layer, modifying the \texttt{theme} layer will allow for a natural background to be implemented,
this is demonstrated in listing \ref{orga811027} and the output is provided in figure \ref{fig:orgb9d1c6a}.

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
wmp <- ggplot(fatalmap, aes(map_id = region)) +
  geom_map(map = fatalmap,  color = "grey", aes(fill = total_deaths_per_million), lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.6)+
  expand_limits(x = fatalmap$long, y = fatalmap$lat)+
  scale_fill_gradient(high = "darkred", low = "white") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend("Total Deaths \n per Million")) +
   # Change the colors of background
   # and the color of grid lines to white
   theme(
     panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                     colour = "lightblue",
                                     size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
     legend.position = c(0.6, 0.1),
     legend.direction = "horizontal",
     legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", size = 0.1, colour = "darkblue", linetype = "solid")) +
   labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", title = TeX("Total Deaths Attributed to \\textit{COVID-19}"))
#   geom_text(data = region_lab_df, aes(y = lat, x = long, label = region), size = 1)
wmp

\end{minted}
\caption{\label{orga811027}use \texttt{ggplot2} to create a chloropleth map from data, output in figure \ref{fig:orgb9d1c6a}}
\end{listing}


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{FirstChALL.png}
\caption{\label{fig:orgb9d1c6a}Chloropleth map of total deaths attributed to \emph{COVID-19} (per Million people)}
\end{figure}

A bubble overlay may also be implemented in order make clearer the spread of cases (see section \ref{orgb5455b6} for a brief literature review), it is necessary however to adjust the \emph{USA} location to represent the mainland population centre in order make the visualisation more effective. This is demonstrated in listing \ref{org85a4e90} and shown in figure \ref{fig:org9c4f0e3}

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}

# Compute the centroid as the mean longitude and lattitude
# Used as label coordinate for country's names
region_lab_df <- some.eu.maps %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(long = mean(long), lat = mean(lat)) %>%
    full_join(aggregate(total_deaths_per_million ~ region, fatalmap, mean))
# Manually Adjust US to be population Centre
region_lab_df[region_lab_df$region == "USA",]$long <- -92.47
region_lab_df[region_lab_df$region == "USA",]$lat <- 37.37


wmp +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 9), name = "Total Number \n of Deaths") +
   guides(size = FALSE) +
   geom_point(data = region_lab_df, aes(y = lat, x = long, size = total_deaths_per_million), alpha = 0.5, col = "purple")
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{org85a4e90}use \texttt{ggplot2} to create a chloropleth map from data, output in figure \ref{fig:orgb9d1c6a}}
\end{listing}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{FirstChAllbub.png}
\caption{\label{fig:org9c4f0e3}Chloropleth map with bubble overlay to aid in case visualisation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Europe Centric}
\label{sec:orgd9124fe}
The chloropleth map clearly shows that the disease has caused significiantly more fatalities
per capita in Europe and so the plot will be adjusted central to Europe.

As before it is necessary to rename the features of the dataset, however in this
instance small European countries such as Belgium should be retained (San marino
is a very small italian provice that isn't detectable in the visualisation and
skews the pallete, for this reason it will be removed), this is demonstrated in
listing \ref{org889a8f2}

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
## Rename to facilitate joining with map
names(fatalprop) <- c("region", "total_deaths_per_million")

## San Marino will be shown by italy
 fatalprop <- fatalprop %>% filter(region!="San Marino")
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{org889a8f2}Rename the features of the data and remove San Marino}
\end{listing}

In this map it will be desirable to have labels for the European countries
(whereas this would have made the worldwide map too busy), so this will be
implemented by using \texttt{dyplyr} to generate a second data set as shown in listing
\ref{orgd09529d} which can then be used to generate a plot with the \texttt{ggrepel} add on as shown in listing \ref{org72a9cb4}, this
produces the output shown in figure \ref{fig:org2f71c00}, bubbles were also implemented in order to help visualise the number of relative cases.

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{r}
fatalmap <- left_join(fatalprop, some.eu.maps, by = "region")

## Filter out only Europe
fatalmap <-  fatalmap %>%
  filter(30 <  lat & lat < 65) %>%
  filter(-30 <  long & long < 35)

## Create Label Data Frame
region_lab_df <- fatalmap %>%
  dplyr::group_by(region) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(long = mean(long), lat = mean(lat)) %>%
   full_join(aggregate(total_deaths_per_million ~ region, fatalmap, mean))
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{orgd09529d}use \texttt{dplyr} to reduce the plot size and create a data frame of country labels}

\subsection{Advantages compared to other methods}
\label{sec:org577682a}
\begin{itemize}
\item A Chloropleth map provides a very clear way to visualise the occurence of
disease in a geographical sense, in contrast to other methods such as scatter
plots, heatmaps and bar charts, the chloropleth map provides a clear way to
distinguish the impact of the disease on individual countries.

The discrete distinction between countries, a fundamental component of a
chloropleth map, is desirable because it is consistent with the independent
legislatures accross countries, this allows for a comparison of the impact
that policy decisions may or may not have on a region.
\end{itemize}

Chloropleth maps also allow trends across regions to be easily identified, e.g.
figure \ref{fig:org2f71c00} shows how severe the outbreak is in \emph{Europe} relative to other
regions, this might be lost in abstraction when using other visualization methods.

\subsection{Disasadvantages}
\label{sec:org16f816a}
When maps are projected into a 2D plane they are necessarily distorted, this
  distortion can impact how spread the data appears to be.

A chloropleth map can make it hard to compare metrics between to regions in any
specific sense, for this a more appropriate visualization would be a bar chart.
\subsection{Literature review of related work}
\label{sec:orgb25c76e}
The \emph{John Hopkins Coronavirus Dashboard} \cite{2020o} implemented bubbles to
visualise the number of cases, a screenshot of this is provided in the appendix
at figure \ref{fig:org412dc19}, this was a part of the motivation for implementing bubbles in
the chloropleth map because the visualization was so much more \emph{striking} and
promoted pre-attentive processing of the information.

\label{orgb5455b6} In his blog, Kenneth Field produced chloropleth and bubble-map charts
detailing the spread of \emph{COVID-19}, with however, a focuse on China, \cite{field2020} these
plots were very similar to those produced in this report, however the legend for
the bubble plot was very nicely implemented and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:org9f1e565} of
the appendix. He also produced an example illustrating why the use of a heatmap
or contour map can make for a poor visualisation of cases due to the difficulty
in interpreting the visualization compared to a bubble chart, for this reason a
bubble chart was used in this report and a heatmap was not implemented.

A paper in the publication \emph{Environment \& Planning A} suggested using a
cartogram to visualise the spread of disease, there example is provided in
figure \ref{fig:orgd058160} of the appendix. \cite{gao2020} Although the cartogram is visually
quite appealing and easy to read, it is difficult to interpret quickly, the
visualisation does not promote pre-attentive processing, for this reason the
visualisation strategy was not implemented.

\section{Time Series}
\label{sec:org7b8838c}
\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:org28b5403}
Time series charts can be an effective way to visualise the behaviour of a value
over time, for this dataset however, two modifications will be implemented in
order to make the trends more distinct.

\subsubsection{Log Scale}
\label{sec:org9371c0f}
The spread of disease over time can often be described by an exponential model as
demonstrated in equations \eqref{exp1} and \eqref{exp2}, for this reason the use of
a \$\(\log\)\$-scale will linearise trends and so the use of a \$\(\log\)\$-scale will make
it easier to compare the rates of population change between different countries.



\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto p &\implies p = Ce^{kt} \quad \exists k,c \in \mathbb{R} \label{exp1} \\
  \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto p \wedge    \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto (N-p) &\implies p = \frac{ke^{Nt}}{1-ke^{Nt}} \quad \exists k \in \mathbb{R}, N \in \mathbb{R^+} \label{exp1} \label{exp2}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Adjust Zero}
\label{sec:orga62083c}
In addition to a \(\log-\) scale, \emph{sliding} the data to be relative to the number
of days since the first case can allow the trends of the data to be compared,
this was implemented by \emph{John Hopkins University} in a visualisation published
in the \emph{Guardian} \cite{gutierrez2020}. \label{orgaa3f855}

\subsection{Technical Details}
\label{sec:org5b1072b}
\subsubsection{Preliminary}
\label{sec:org8718a60}
In order to log scale the data the \texttt{mutate} function from the \texttt{dplyr} package
was used on data transformed into \emph{wide} format by using the \texttt{pivot\_wider}
function, this is shown in listing \ref{org469b4d6}.

Sliding the date back to the number of cases however was a little more difficult
and required the use of a \texttt{for} loop to iterate the \texttt{lead} function over each
column (where each column, after transformation with \texttt{dplyr}, represented the
value for a country), this is demonstrated in listing \ref{org469b4d6} with an example of the
produced \emph{tidy} data provided in table \ref{tab:org5cf6def}; the code to produce the plot is
demonstrated in listing \ref{org19be2d1}, the output of which is provided in figure \ref{fig:orgbc8ceb4}.

Rather than using a line plot or a scatter plot, a \texttt{loess} model was placed ontop of semi-opaque points, this is to enhance the continuity of the visualisation. The \emph{Gestalt Laws} provide that continuous shapes are easier for readers to interpret \cite{staudinger2011} and for this reason the the overlay was implemented, to aid the reader in delineating between the different countries in a plot.

Plots with many colours mapped to categorical variables can be difficult to interpret \cite{wilson2017,rost2018}, for this reason less than 10 countries were compared on the same plot.

\subsubsection{Facet Grid}
\label{sec:org82df0c5}
This plot however does not show all the data made available, the data set also includes information on the number of tests,cases and deaths resulting from \emph{COVID-19}, in order to visualise this the \texttt{fact\_grid} layer can be used to create a multi-scatterplot. first it is necessary to create a data frame, this can be implemented by repeating the process in listing \ref{org469b4d6} for each different metric but it will also be necessary to add a feature corresponding to that metric's description, we will also create non-log scaled data as well, this is demonstrated in listings \ref{org1e3ed66} through \ref{orge990e83}, finally the dataframes are merged in listing \ref{org200144a}, the corresponding plot is shown in figure \ref{fig:org54b906e}.

\subsection{Advantages compared to other methods}
\label{sec:org456bcd3}
\begin{itemize}
\item The advantage to a log-scaled plot is that it allows rates of change to be
compared between countries
\item Making the Data Relative to the day of the first infection allows individual
countries to be compared in terms of there response
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Disasadvantages}
\label{sec:orga4092e5}
\begin{itemize}
\item A log-scaled plot can be misleading if it is not made clear, his particularly
true for readers who have limited mathematical training.
\begin{itemize}
\item For this reason a plot without log-scaling was included and the axis were
labelled accordingly
\end{itemize}
\item Making Data relative to the day of the first infection may not make clear that
certain countries had \emph{/forewarning} of the disease by virtue of the delay.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussion on analysis results}
\label{sec:org1c13b30}
This plot demonstrates that
\subsection{Discussion on other Aspects}
\label{sec:orgff928f4}
\begin{itemize}
\item A potential improvement to this plot would be to plot many countries, say 30 but greyscale those countries and only apply colour to countries of interest, this would provide background information relative to those observations but not overwhelm the reader, this is a suggestion made by Andy Kirk in his \emph{Visualising Data} blog  \cite{kirk2015}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Literature review of related work}
\label{sec:org6b4f9b5}
As mentioned in section \ref{orgaa3f855} the use of the log-scaled and date-adjusted plot was implemented by \emph{John Hopkins University} in a visualisation published in \emph{The Guardian} newspaper \cite{gutierrez2020}.


NSW Health created a visualisation of cases acquired over time using a barchart
in a way that resembles a histogram, \cite{nswhealth2020} this plot is very easy
to interpret and clearly demonstrates the success of NSW in \emph{flattening the
curve}, this visualisation could have been implemented for this data as demonstrated in listing \ref{orgbc3815c} shown in figure \ref{fig:org523e75a} for different countries in a similar fashion, this however was not effective for comparing countries and so was not pursued.
