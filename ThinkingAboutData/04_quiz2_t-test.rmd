# Question 1
Compute the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for the mean BD for females - mean BD for males. Assume equal variances.

```{r}
c1 <- read.csv("./0datasets/crabsJ1hcWQfwp52r3XqzMIh4.csv")
head(c1)
t.test(BD ~ sex, data = c1, var.equal = TRUE, conf = 0.9)
```


# Question 2
The centre line is the median of a boxplot

# Question 3
Use R and a t test to compute a p-value for a difference in mean length of carapace length (CL) by sex. Assume equal variances.
```{r}
c2 <- read.csv("./0datasets/crabsINtTIDdA9ps6siFdyHIJ.csv")
head(c2)
t.test(CL ~ sex, data = c2, var.equal = TRUE, conf = 0.9)
```


# Question 4
Use R and a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to compute a p-value for a difference in mean size of rear width (RW) by sex.
```{r}
c3 <- read.csv("./0datasets/crabsuHxn8uYEHU750PEuUzNo.csv")
head(c1)
wilcox.test(RW ~ sex, c3, alternative = "two.sided")
```
