# Problem
>  The health minister of Australia has been concerned about the increase in new cases of people infected with
> the Tiara virus. They have hired you as a consultant to examine their data on the new cases of Tiara virus
> and the flu. The data is provided to you in a CSV file called project2020A.csv containing observations of
> the daily new cases of both the Tiara and flu viruses for each state in Australia over a 100 day period. The
> variables are:
> 
> * `city`: The city in which the new cases of the virus is counted.
> * `newTiara`: The number of new cases of the Tiara virus for the day.
> * `newFlu`: The number of new cases of the flu virus for the day.
> * `date`: the day number starting from 1 and ending at 100.
> 
> The health minister wants statistics measured from the data so that they can be reported to the public. The
> five required pieces of analysis are presented below.
