# Question 2 
## 1. Write a function that takes a vector of numbers as its input data and randomly picks 10% of thenumbers, then writes that subsample into a new vector
the `sample` function can be used to take a sample from a vector:

```{r}
subsample <- function(vec) {
  n <- length(vec)
  sample(vec, size = 0.1*n, replace = FALSE) 
                           ## For a bootstrap replace should be TRUE
}

```

## 2. Test your function by creating a vector of 1000 random samples from a normal distribution withmean 1 and standard deviation 2, and then sampling 100 numbers from it.
The `rnorm` function can be used to generate normally distributed values and passing this to the previously defined `subsample` function will extract a random sample of 10% of the values:

```{r}
norm_values <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 1, sd = 2)
(norm_ss <- subsample(norm_values))
```

## 3. Output the mean and standard deviation of the 100-number subsample
```{r}
rbind(c(
  "Mean"   = mean(norm_ss),
  "StdDev" = sd(norm_ss))
  )
```

## 4. Call the function 100 times to get 100 different 100-number subsamples of the same 1000-numbervector as used above, calculate their means and standard deviations, and then plot histograms of themeans and standard deviations of the subsamples.

First resample the vector of values 100 times and produce a matrix using `replicate`[^1]:
```{r}
## Resample the Values
boot_vals <- replicate(100, {
  subsample(norm_values)
})
```
Each Column of the output matrix corresponds to a seperate sample, so in order to get the mean and sd of each sample the `apply` function can be used, specifying the `MARGIN` argument as `2` in order to denote function operating column-wise.

```{r}
## Collumns correspond to the sample number and the rows to obsevations
## 
## Calculate the mean values
sample_means <- apply(boot_vals, 2, mean)

## Calculate the STD Dev
sample_sd    <- apply(boot_vals, 2, sd)
```

In order to plot the histograms it is first necessary to manipulate the data such that it is in a `tidy` format, this can be done by using the `tidyr` package, then the histograms can be plotted using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(means = sample_means, sds = sample_sd)
tidy_data <- tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(means, sds), data = data, names_to = "Parameter")
tidy_data$Parameter <- factor(tidy_data$Parameter, labels = c("Mean", "SD"), ordered = FALSE)
tidy_data

ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = value, fill = Parameter, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "black", binwidth = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Parameter, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_bw()  +
  labs(x = "Value", y = "Density",
       title = TeX('Bootstrapped Descriptive statistics from $X \\sim \\textit{N} (2,1)$'))
##  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(data$means),
##                                         sd = sd(data$means)))

```

# Question 3
## 1. Display the image in a plot.

First load the JPEG file into **_R_** using the `readJPEG` function:
```{r}
## read in the JPEG File
img <- readJPEG("./figure/mandrill.jpg")
### could also use native format
img.n <- readJPEG("./figure/mandrill.jpg", native = TRUE)
```

Now the image can be plotted by using the `grid.raster` function:

```{r}
## Without the plot/axis
grid.raster(img)
## grid.raster(img.n)
```

If however we desired to use a plot window we could first create one using `plot` and instead use the `rasterImage` function:
```{r}
## With the axis
plot(x = 0:1, y = 0:1, type = "n")
## grid.raster(img)
rasterImage(img, 0, 0, 1, 1)
## grid.raster(img.n)
```

## 2. Plot only the red colour plane.
> The JPEG image comprises separate images (or “planes”) in the three primary colours, Red, Greenand Blue. Plot only the Red colour plane.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
reds   <- img[,,1]
  reds <- t(reds[rev(1:nrow(reds)),])
greens <- img[,,2]
  greens <- t(greens[rev(1:nrow(greens)),])
blues  <- img[,,3]
  blues <- t(blues[rev(1:nrow(blues)),])

## Make a Red Pallete
cols <- rgb(red = 0:10, green = 0, blue = 0, maxColorValue = 10)

## Preview the Pallete
barplot(seq(1, length.out = length(cols)), col = cols)
# cols <- rgb(1:255, 1:255, 1:255, maxColorValue = 255)

## Make a broader spectrum
cols <- rgb(red = 0:255, green = 0, blue = 0, maxColorValue = 255)

## Plot the red layer using the pallete
plot(x = 0:1, y = 0:1, type = "n")
image(reds, col = cols)

```

This unfourtunately produces artifacts when exporting the plot, so a seuperior option is to use `raster.image` and modify the channels green and blue channels to be zero:


```{r}
plot(x = 0:1, y = 0:1, type = "n")
img_r <- img
img_r[,,2:3] <- 0
rasterImage(img_r, 0, 0, 1, 1)
```



## 3. Plot a histogram of the Red values of all the pixels in the image.
A histogram of the values may be plotted by passing them to `ggplot` (`barplot` or `hist` could also have been used):

```{r}
## hist(reds)

ggplot(data = data.frame(reds = as.vector(reds)), aes(x = reds, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "indianred", col = "pink")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Intensity of Red Channel", y = "Density", title = "Histogram of Red Values from Image")
```

## 4. Plot the red, green and blue pixel values of all the pixels in a horizontal line across the middle of theimage (i.e. all pixels with a vertical index of 256).

```{r}
## Extract the values from centre horizontal line
rel_vals <- img[, 256, ]

## Make a Tibble from the DAta
rel_vals_tb <- as_tibble(rel_vals)
names(rel_vals_tb) <- c("Red", "Green", "Blue")
rel_vals_tb$index <- 1:nrow(rel_vals)


## Make the Data Frame Tidy
rel_vals_tb_tidy <-
  pivot_longer(data = rel_vals_tb,
               cols = c(Red, Green, Blue),
               names_to = "Colour")

## Preserve the order of RGB
rel_vals_tb_tidy$Colour <-
  factor(
    rel_vals_tb_tidy$Colour,
    levels = c("Red", "Green", "Blue"),
    ordered = TRUE
  )


## Remember that ggplot2 uses alpha
ggplot(data = rel_vals_tb_tidy, aes(x = index, y = value, col = Colour)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Indianred3", "Palegreen3", "Deepskyblue3")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Index",
    y = "Value",
    title = "RGB Values Across Centre Horizontal Line",
    subtitle = "Corresponding to Mandril Image "
  )
```


# Question 4

## a.Imimtate a sequence of Dice Rolls
> Try to imitate a sequence of dice rolls. Create a vector of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), of length 51. Beas random as you can. Do this before you read the rest of the question. (Or, get someone else to doit.) Print your sequence.

```{r}
(my_seq <- c(1,2,2,2,1,2,3,4,1,4,4,5,1,4,6,3,4,5,6,1,1,1,1,2,
            3,4,2,1,3,6,1,3,4,1,3,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,3,2,6,4,3,1,6,1,3))
length(my_seq)
```


## b. Devise a test to real dice-rolling, 
> Can we devise a test to distinguish between the fake dice-rolling and real dice-rolling, i.e. a trulyrandom process? One method is based on the observation that people tend to put fewer runs ofnumbers in their sequences than you find in random sequences. Write code to count the number ofruns of 1 (i.e. each number that is not followed by the same number), 2 (i.e. 2 consecutive numbersthe same), 3 and 4.

```{r}
runs <- rle(my_seq)
tab <- table(runs$lengths)

## The question asks for lengths 1 to 4, so to be precice
tab <- table(runs$lengths) %>% append(values = seq(0, 0, length.out = 4))
tab <- tab[1:4]
```


## c.How many runs of each length would we get if the data were truly random? 
> How many runs of each length would we get if the data were truly random? Write a loop to simulate105sets of 51 tosses, storing the number of runs of each length (1, 2, 3, 4). Plot the histogram of runs(i.e. total number of runs of each length added up over al

```{r}
n <- 10^5
# sim_seq <- 
sim_seq <- replicate(n, {
  ## Sample a Dice throw
  s_dice <- sample(1:6, size = 51, replace = TRUE)
  
  ## Count the Runs
  s_runs <- rle(s_dice)
  
  ## Tabulate the Counts but pad the end with zeroe's so length=4
  s_runs_tb <- table(s_runs$lengths) %>% append(values = seq(0, 0, length.out = 4))
  
  ## Make it a Matrix
  s_runs_tb[1:4] %>% unlist() %>% matrix(ncol = 4)
}) %>% unlist() %>% as.vector() %>% matrix(ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE) #TODO How to Turn from list into vector 

```

### Plot the Histogram of Runs

```{r}
col_names_run_count <- c("One", "Two", "Three", "Four")
sim_seq_tib <- as_tibble(sim_seq)
names(sim_seq_tib) <- col_names_run_count

sim_seq_tib %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(One, Two, Three, Four)) %>% 
  mutate(name = factor(name, labels = col_names_run_count, ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = name, x = value, y = ..density..)) +
    geom_histogram(col = "black") +
    facet_grid(. ~ name, scales = "free_y") +
    theme_bw() + 
    labs(x = "Run Count",
         title = "Simulated Runs",
         subtitle = TeX("Histogram of Runs \\textit{streaks} for 51 rolls of a fair die"),
         y = "Density")

```


```{r}
## Set up a colour Pallete
plt <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, name = "Dark2")

## Loop over the possible Names
p <- list()
j <- 1

for (i in col_names_run_count) {
p[[i]] <- paste0("ggplot(sim_seq_tib, aes(y = ..density.., x = ", i, ")) +
                 geom_histogram(fill = '", plt[j], "' , binwidth = 1) +
                 theme_bw() + 
                 labs(y = 'Density')")
j <- j+1
}

## Evaluate the List Contents to make the plots
for (i in 1:length(p)) {
p[[i]] <- eval(parse(text = p[[i]])) 
}

# Use Grid Arrange to lay them out
  # Refer to [this note](~/Notes/MD/Programming/R/Visualisation/Multiple Plots in R.md)
grid.arrange(grobs = p, layout_matrix = matrix(1:4, ncol = 2))
  
```





### Print the Totals
The total number of runs that occured over the simulations can be returned by using `apply`:

```{r}
apply(sim_seq_tib, 2, sum)
```

It may however be more instructive to inspect the average number of runs over the simulations compared to the human generated sequence:

```{r}
data.frame("Simulated" = apply(sim_seq_tib, 2, mean),
           "Human" = as.vector(tab)) %>% 
  kable()
```


























[^1]: `replicate` is a wrapper for `sapply` and is usually quicker than using a loop, loops using a dynamic vector are often slow, `replicate` has the added benefit that it is not necessary to define a static vector either.
